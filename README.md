JBookTrader is a fully automated trading system (ATS) that can trade various types of market securities during the trading day without user monitoring. All aspects of trading, such as obtaining market prices, analyzing price patterns, making trading decisions, placing orders, monitoring order executions, and controlling the risk are automated according to the user preferences. The central idea behind JBookTrader is to completely remove emotions from trading, so that the trading system can systematically and consistently follow a predefined set of rules.
